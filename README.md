# fa-material

fa-material is the easiest way to use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Pro icons in
your [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) project.

An active Font Awesome Pro license is required to use fa-material.

## Installation

1. [Install Font Awesome Pro's Python package](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/use-with/python-django#using-font-awesome-pro-with-django).
2. Install fa-material.

   ```bash
   pip install fa-material
   ```

## Usage

Add the `fontawesome-pro` plugin to `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - fontawesome-pro
```

That's it. You can now use Font Awesome Pro icons in the same way you already do Font Awesome Free icons (e.g.
`:fontawesome-thin-user-secret:`). They'll work in Markdown files, `mkdocs.yml`, and anywhere else Material for MkDocs'
icon system is used.

## License

fa-material is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md).
