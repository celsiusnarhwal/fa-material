# Changelog[^1]

Notable changes to Iconoclast will be documented here. Breaking changes are marked with a ðŸš©.

Iconoclast adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## <a name="3.0.1">[3.0.1] - 2024-11-22</a>

### Fixed

### Changes

- ðŸš© Iconoclast now requires Python 3.8 or later.

### Changed

- Iconoclast's warning and error messages are now visually consistent with those emitted by MkDocs.

## <a name="2-0-1">[2.0.1] - 2023-05-11</a>

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where Iconoclast's command-line interface would fail.

## <a name="2-0-0">[2.0.0] - 2023-05-05</a>

        version: 5
  ```
